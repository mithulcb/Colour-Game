# Colour-Game
To make the color game. The game basically provides you with text on the 
screen. The text will be a color but the text font color will be different. 
The objective of the user will be to basically identify and type the color of 
the text rather than the what the text is. It might be quite confusing to 
understand, so follow this example. 
Suppose the computer provides the following text: -
<br><h1>BLACK</h1><br>
The user is required to input ‘white’ rather than black. He/she will have to 
identify the color of the text in a given amount of type.
